1.	I created a new diffutils directory since the patch would notify me of
	reverting changes.

2.	I checked out and created a new branch.
	> git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3.	Apply the patch:
	> patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
	This notified me that there were 6 files that were patched.

4.	Addded a change log entry using the emacs 'C-x 4 a' command.

5.	-

6.	Commit the changes to the new branch:
	> git add .
	> git commit -F ChangeLog

7.	Generate a new patch using:
	> git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

	I will need to create a new branch 'partner' to apply someone else's
	patch:
	> git checkout v3.0 -b partner
	> git am < formatted-patch.txt
	Then build it:
	> ./bootstrap
	> ./configure
	> make
	> make check

9.	Verify the ChangeLog entry by using:
	> make distdir
	> cd diffutils*
	Opening the ChangeLog file will show the entries my partner had written
	for the 6 files prior.

10.	Clone a new 'emacs' repository:
	> git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
	I then used Putty and XMing to connect to lnxsrv02 and open up gitk in
	emacs. The merge that appeared to be no later than January 25, 2015 was
	"Merge branch 'master' into xwidget".
