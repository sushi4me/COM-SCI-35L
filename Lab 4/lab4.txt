LABORATORY: MANAGING A BACKPORTED CHANGE

1.    I cloned a the Diffutils repository using:
      > git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2.    Export the log into a text file:
      > git log > git-log.txt

3.    Export the tags into a text file:
      > git tag > git-tags.txt

4.    Open the git-log.txt and search for the commit. Copy the hashcode from
      notepad and paste into the Putty terminal using the right click.
      Then create a patch by using the 'git show' command with the 
      corresponding hash.
      > git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5.    Check out v3.0 from Diffutils repo:
      > git checkout v3.0

6.    > patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
      The patch was not able to find some files:
      	  HACKING
	  diffutils.texi
	  help2man
      And had failed to completely patch some files:
      	  README
	  README-hacking
	  cfg.mk
	  diff.c
	  diff3.c

7.    I can check the status of the patch by:
      > git status
      This shows all modified and untracked files.

8.    Revert changes on not *.c files using:
      C-x v = C-x v u
      Which opens the vc-diff buffer and reverts all changes.
   
9.    Revert changes in *.c files which do not affect code (is part of a 
      comment).  We can revert hunks using the command:
      C-u C-c C-a

10.   Check the *.c.rej files for any patches that were not applied and change
      them manually.

11.   To check what files will be removed running 'git clean':
      > git clean -n
      We can then clean the status by:
      > git clean -f
      The command refuses to clean without the force option.

12.   We can check the status again using:
      > git status | grep 'modified'
      The only six mofified files are - cmp.c, diff.c, diff3.c, dir.c, sdiff.c,
      util.c
      This will output only 6 files that were modified and we can then output 
      the quote-3.0-patch.txt by:
      > git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13.   For this step I had switch over to lnxsrv02 instead. I built the modified
      version of Diffutils using the following commands:
      > ./bootstrap
      > ./configure
      > make

14.   Place the contents of the src file into a diffutils-3.0-patch directory.
      Check out diffutils v3.0 and do the same however place it into the
      diffutils-3.0 directory.  Then invoke:
      > ./diffutils-3.0-patch/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > 
      	quote-3.0-test.txt
      There are files are not identical.

15.   The differences are innocuous, they are part of the changes from ' to `.
