Lab Assignment #1

1.  man -k keyword
Use the command 'man man' to look up the options.

2.  /usr/bin/cp
    /usr/bin/wc
The 'whereis' command gives the location of the file, 'which' also works.

3.  find /usr/bin -name "?" -executable
Use the find command and its options to narrow the search to single character
commands.
    /usr/bin/w
shows who is logged on and what they are doing
    /usr/bin/x
a portable, network-transparent window system
    /usr/bin/[
check file types and compare values

4.  readlink /usr/bin/emacs
    /etc/alternatives/emacs

5.  The symbolic g+s allows the group to use the file as if they were the owner.
The symbolic o-x takes away the executable permission for 'others'.

6.  find -mtime -21 -print
Use the options of 'find' to restrict files that have been accessed within the
past 21 days.

7.  find -mtime -21 -type d -print
Use the same command as before, however set the type of files to only be
directories.

8.  find /usr/bin -type l
Use 'whereis' option to find the location of 'find', then use the 'find' command
to only show symbolic links; 242 of them are symbolic links.

9.  cd /usr/bin
    ls -lt
The oldest file in the directory is detect_ppa, accessed Sept. 8, 2000.

10. The command locale get its data from localedef, using the man pages for
locale we find that the command when invoked without arguments gives us
information on the current locale environment.  The localedef command on the
other hand defines the locale environment.

11. The command 'C-h a sort ENTER' allows for a search through emacs manual.
Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort
tabulated-list-sort

12. The command 'C-h b' gives a list of commands in emacs.
C-M-a	move backward to the beginning of a line
C-M-b	move backward one character
C-M-c	exit from the inner-most recursive edit
C-M-d	move forward down one level of parentheses
C-M-e	move forward to the beginning of a line
C-M-f	move forward one character
C-M-g	undefined
C-M-h	mark function

13. Found the C-g command through 'C-h b Enter'.
C-g is the keyboard-quit command, signals a 'quit' condition.

14. Found the yank function through 'C-h a yank Enter'.
The yank function reinserts the last stretch of killed text.

15. Found the dired function through 'C-h a dired Enter'.
The emacs command dired can view, delete, rename, print, etc. files within a
directory whereas the command ls -l can only view the files in the directory.
