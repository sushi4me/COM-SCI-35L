If we compile a program this way:

	gcc -Wall item.cpp shoppingList.cpp shop.cpp -o shop

then this will prove problematic if we were to change the contents of a header file.  Therefore we should use:

	gcc -Wall -c item.cpp
	gcc item.o shoppingList.o shop.o -o shop

This yields more commands but shortens the compilation.

* configure
	Checks dettails about the machine before installation
	Creates 'Makefile'
* make
	Requires 'Makefile' to run
	Compiles all the program code and creates executables in current temp. dir

* make install
	Executables are copied into system files
