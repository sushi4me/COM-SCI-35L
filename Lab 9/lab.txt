Insert the disk and restart the computer, the Ubuntu prompt should appear. Click
on TRY Ubuntu in order to prevent installing Ubuntu onto the machine. 

1.	Make sure the proper files are installed:
	> dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
	I did not have openssh-server installed, so I used:
	> sudo apt-get install openssh-server

2.	CLIENT STEPS
        Generate a public & private key:
        > ssh-keygen
	By default we can find the public and private keys in:
	~/.ssh/is_rsa
	~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

3.      Copy this key for key-based authentification
        > ssh-copy-id -i nathank@10.97.85.138
        Add the private key:
        > ssh-add
        Connect to the server:
        > ssh -X nathank@10.97.85.138
        We use the -X option to allow X11 forwarding. Attempt to run an
        application such as gedit, firefox or xterm.        
        
4.      Attempting to open up gedit or firefox yielded some warnings however,
        they did not prevent them from opening. Xterm opened up perfectly fine.

5.	SERVER STEPS
	Generate a public & private key:
	> ssh-keygen
	I did not add a password for the key.

6.	Add a new user for the client:
	> sudo useradd -d /home/homedir -m griffinr
	> sudo passwd

7.	We create a new .ssh directory for the new user in /home/homdir:
	> sudo mkdir .ssh
	> sudo chown -R griffinr .ssh
	> sudo chmod 700 .ssh
	We can also disable password-based authentication using:
	> gedit /etc/ssh/ssh_config
	Change #PasswordAuthentication from 'yes' to 'no'

8.      Griffin went through similar steps mentioned in CLIENT STEPS.
        However, he would connect to me using the command:
        > ssh -X griffinr@10.97.85.142
