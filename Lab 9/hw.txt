1.	Over SSH, the data is encrypted therefore it would not be understandable
	despite another team listening over the channel. Also they do not have
	the private key to decrypt the message.

	Tapping into the keyboards would allow for teams to gain access to the
	username and password. This allows them to login to obtain the private
	key.

	If the team had physical control of the USB then they would be able to
	obtain the private key. This would allow them to decrypt any incoming
	messages from clients.

2.	The command 'gpg --verify' can only verify document integrity however
	gives no reference as to its origin. It could be the case that there
	is a user C which sits between two communicating users A and B which
	changes the message digest and the public key identifier. Upon 
	receiving this message we only know the contents but not the origin.
	Using a certificate of authority we are able to verify the identity
	of the sender based on digitally issued certificates.
