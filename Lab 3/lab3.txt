LABORATORY: INSTALLING A SMALL CHANGE TO A BIG PACKAGE

1. I downloaded coreutils-7.6 using:
   wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2. Extract the tar.gz with the following options:
   tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
   The options were found via 'man tar', x being extract, z filters gzip, v
   prints the processed files, and f to use archive files.

3. Make a new directory:
   mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall

4. Changing directories to coreutils-7.6 and executing the following to compile
   and install:
   ./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/nathank/coreutilsInstall; make; make install
   I have to set the prefix in order to direct the installation into a specific
   directory, without this I would not be able to install the files into the
   default path due to restricted permissions.

5. To reproduce the bug I can navigate to:
   /u/ee/ugrad/nathank/coreutils-7.6/src/
   and execute the command:
   ./ls -l
   This should reproduce the bug since it calls coreutils' version of ls.
   Calling ls by itself without indicating the path to it in coreutils-7.6 will
   call the ls located in /bin/ which will not reproduce the bug.

6. Copy and paste the patch via Emacs, named ls.patch and relocate it into the
   same directory as /u/ee/ugrad/nathank/coreutils-7.6/src/

7. Apply the patch to the ls.c file located in .../coreutils-7.6/src:
   patch -p1 < ls.patch
   We choose the option -p1 in order to strip away the first slash in Brady's
   patch.  The original path within the file is not accurate therefore we
   strip it away to have 'src/ls.c' which is where our file is actually located.

8. After patching the ls.c file, change directories back to .../coreutils-7.6
   and execute the 'make' command to compile the new changes.

9. Afterwards I tested the newly patched ls in the .../coreutils-7.6/src by
   using the command:
   ./ls -l
   the new dates are changed from numerical only to also include the actual
   month's labels.

10. To test I created a new file in the directory using:
    touch -t 201402200000 oldfile.txt
    Using the ls command to view the file, it retains the intended formatting.
    Recently modified files will show the month, date and time it was modified
    whereas a year-old modified file will have the year instead of a time.
