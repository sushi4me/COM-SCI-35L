LABORATORY: INSTALLING A SMALL CHANGE TO A BIG PACKAGE

Q1. The line "case_long_iso_time_style:" was deleted because it was a duplicate
    line within a case statement. Having removed the line or not the case above
    which was the same would have simply fell through.

Q2. In other countries which do not understand English-format dates, this patch
    would simply cause confusion.  However this patch may cause bugs if there 
    is code which pulls the dates of files, there would be a big difference in
    data representation for integer 10 instead of "Oct".

Q3. The randline.py file uses the 'choice' function of random, giving randline
    an empty file will raise IndexError (from Python documentation of random).
    In particular we should see "IndexError: list index out of range" due to
    the existence of an empty list when the expected argument for 'choice'
    should have at least one element.

Q4. Running randline.py in Python3 gives the error:
    	    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
	    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    This error is brought on by the fact that exceptions in Python 2 are
    iterable, this is not the case in Python 3.  Python 2 iterates its arg
    parameters by iterating through the exception itself.
