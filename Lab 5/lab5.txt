1.	Download the version of coreutils and the patch.
	> wget web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with
	  -bug.tar.gz
	> wget web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

2.	Unpack the coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz.
	> tar -zxf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

3.	Attempt to configure and make the coreutils as-is.
	> ./configure
	> make
	However, the result is a failure because the variable 'futimens' is
	declared twice with differing types.  It is declared once as an int,
	and a second time as extern int.

4.	Patch the version of coreutils while within the directory of coreutils
	and then attempt to configure and make coreutils.
	> path -p0 < coreutils.diff
	> ./configure
	> make

5.	Recreate the bug following the steps:
	> tmp=$(mktemp -d)
	> cd $tmp
	> touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
	> touch now
	> sleep 1
	> touch now1
	> TZ=UTC0 ~/Lab5/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time
	  wwi-armistice now now1
	The result is a list of the three files sorted by their time stamps in
	descending order.  However, the old file (dating back to 1918) appears
	at the top of the list where the newest time-stamped files appear.

6.	Find the bug within ls.c via GDB.
	> emacs ls.c
	> M-x g d b Enter
	Place breakpoints at various functions to find a possible bug.
	By intuition, I would suspect an overflow condition in which a
	function returns the wrong value when a large number is being
	used in a arithmetic calculation.

	Using gdb, I was able to step through the code using 's' and 'n',
	's' is able to step into functions whereas 'n' is not.  

	**Changing the diff variable to accomodate for a larger range got
	rid of the overflow problem in the function.  Therefore we also cast
	the three variables used in the function to be 'signed long int' 
	instead of just 'int'.

7.	Make a copy of the timespec.h and naming it timespecnew.h.  The
	changes were made in timespecpatch.h and then the changelog was
	modified.
	> C-x 4 a
	> diff -u timespec.h timespecnew.h > lab5.diff

8.	Attempting to reproduce the error in the home directory of the SEASnet
	home directory will show that the wwi-armistice file was accessed in
	the future (year 2054).  The file shows up in the correct order, given
	that the time stamp is incorrect.  This is probably due to the mismatch
	between 64-bit and 32-bit architectures.
