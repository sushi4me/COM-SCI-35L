LABORATORY: SPELL-CHECKING HAWAIIAN:

The following commands can be described as:

    1. tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
       The file that this command operates on will replace all characters that
       is not A-Z or a-z, and replace it with the new line character, due to 
       the complement option. Therefore the output is a file that separates all
       string of Latin characters on new lines.
    
    2. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
       The command will output a file that replaces all characters that is not
       A-Z or a-z, and replace it with the new line character.  However, the 
       s-option compresses sequences of identical adjacent characters as one.
       An exmaple would be instead of three spaces being replaced with three 
       new lines, there would only be one new line since the three consecutive
       spaces are compressed into one.

    3. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
       The command will output the same file as the previous command #2.
       Afterwards, the separated strings in order according to the locale 
       ordering, therefore the strings will sort upper case higher than lower
       case in the locale 'C'.

    4. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
       The command will operate similarly to command #3, however the output will
       only have a unique list of sorted lines.  For example, if the string of
       characters 'ABC' appears twice after the translate command, it will only
       appear once in the list after sorting.

    5. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
       The command will compare the words in the sorted HTML file and words.
       The first column will contain words unique to the HTML file, second
       column will contain words unique to the words file, and third column
       will contain words seen in both files.

    6. tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
       The command will yield a similar output to command #5, however it will
       suppress the second and third columns meaning the only output is the
       column displaying words unique only to the sorted HTML file.

The following file is the buildwords script:
